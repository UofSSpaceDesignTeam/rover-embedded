This is just a quick list of things I can think of that we still need to do on the arm board


TODO
====
- [X] Finish duty-cycle manager but for the time being we can just set everything to +/- 255 depending on the direction. **NEEDS TESTING**
- [X] Test communication
- [X] Finish control file
- [X] Fill in pinout
- [X] Test feedback
- [X] Write .ino file
- [X] Find proper resistance to add to L1 (4.7k)
- [X] Calibrate arm
- [X] Add limits.
- [X] Figure out how to determine if a motor should be shut off until the next command for inverse kin. Always on and use tolerance
- [X] Inverse kinematics
- [ ] Test inverse kin
- [X] Look into whether position ranges need to be normalized
- [X] Make it so that the arm can send back its position data to the rover
- [X] Implement the encoder feedback for the base rotation
- [ ] Controller support.
- [ ] Inverse Kinematics Controller support.
- [ ] **NEW** Look at automating some basic movements
- [ ] Lots of wiring
- [ ] Testing, testing, testing!!

There's probably more but this is what I could think of off the top of my head.
